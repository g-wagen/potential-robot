# Working title: potential-robot

## Description
Ever felt the pain when you had a few cooking ingredients at home but no idea what to cook from them?

I'm planning to help out with this project.
The plan is to deploy a Web-App where you get recipe recommendations based on your available ingredients.

This is a work in progress, but feel free to check it out anyway.

## Project structure

### Web Scraper
The web-scraper and ETL stuff can be found [here](potential-robot/scraper/).

### Database diagram
![Alt text](./potential-robot_erd.svg)

## Ready
- Recipe extraction from allrecipes.com by web scraping (but not finished yet)
- Scraping using Proxy servers (automatic proxy server collection and testing)
- Storing scraped recipes to json files and loading it onto the database
- Directly loading the scraped recipes into the database
- Database connection to [bit.io](https://bit.io/betonk/potential-robot)
- Around 3000 recipes in the database

## Backlog (unordered)
- Write a few more scrapers and/or API connections to pull more recipes
- Further cleanup the database (the ingredients table has a lot of similar entries which are almost duplicates: "boiled water" vs "hot water")
- Add pagination support for the allrecipes scraper
- Deploy the scraper with Docker for continuous operation
- Create CI/CD pipeline
- Move project to AWS
- Deploy the Web-App
- Write better documentation ;-)
- Grow the backlog
